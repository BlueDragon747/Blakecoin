## About Blakecoin (0.15.2)

Blakecoin is the original Blake-256 coin and parent chain for [Photon](https://github.com/BlueDragon747/photon), [BlakeBitcoin](https://github.com/BlakeBitcoin/BlakeBitcoin), [Electron](https://github.com/BlueDragon747/Electron-ELT), [Universal Molecule](https://github.com/BlueDragon747/universalmol), and [Lithium](https://github.com/BlueDragon747/lithium).

- Uses the **Blake-256** hashing algorithm — a SHA-3 candidate faster than Scrypt, SHA-256D, Keccak, and Groestl
- Forked from **Bitcoin Core 0.15.2** (autotools build system, HD wallets)
- Optimized 8-round Blake-256 with reduced double-hashing for efficiency
- Maintains proven ECDSA security
