Forked from Bitcoin reference wallet 0.8.5

Blakecoin Wallet

http://www.blakecoin.org

Blake-256(optimized) faster than scrypt and faster than sha256 in C (asm is still faster for sha256d)

The algorithm was written as a candidate for sha3, Based on round one candidate code from the sphlib 2.1 and reduced the compression function to 8.

Tweaks Removed some of the double hashing from the wallet as it is wasteful on compute, No changes to the ecdsa public/private function as that has proven to be secure so far on bitcoin.


What is Blakecoin?

Blakecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant payments to
